# planet-client

This is the client for my kinda weird and probably not gonna be finished planet-game. IDK why anyone is here but if they are then here are some build instructions.

## Build instructions

You must have these dependencies installed:
    asio (may need to build it from source)
    boost
    jsoncpp
and perhaps others.

### Windows

Building on windows is not currently supported. minwingw may work however IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED!

### Linux (Mac?)

Just run `make`. Simple as that. This generates a binary called `client` which can be run.

### "It's not running!"

You need the server started too. For that go to https://github.com/Jachdich/planet-server
